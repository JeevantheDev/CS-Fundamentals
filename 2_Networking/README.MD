- **OSI Model** - The open systems Interconnection model is a reference model that describes how applications interact with each other over a computer network. <br />
The OSI Model has 7 layers:- 
Physical → DataLink → Network → Transport →  Session → Presentation → Application.<br />
- **Physical** - This is the lowest level of the OSI Model. Here, data is converted into an electrical impulse so that it can be sent through a physical medium. It is also responsible for the physical connection between the devices.<br />
- **Datalink**- Data packet is encoded and decoded into bits.<br />
- **Network** - The function of this layer is routing and logical addressing.<br />
- **Transport** - This layer is responsible for end-to-end connections. The data in this layer are called segments.<br />
- **Session** -  This layer controls signals between computers. It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between processes.<br />
- **Presentation** -  It is responsible to translate data into the application layer format. The data is formatted, encrypted and then sent to the next layer.<br />
- **Application** - Services are provided to the end-user.When the data is transmitted over a network it can be transmitted in either of these three manners:<br />
- **Unicast** - Information is sent from a single user to a single receiver. (Point to Point Communication). <br />
- **Multicast** - Data is sent from 1 or more sources to multiple destinations. ( IGMP to identify groups)<br />
- **Broadcast** - It is known as one to all. Communication is between a single user and multiple receivers. <br />
- **DNS** - Domain name system. Responsible for mapping the domain to a corresponding IP address. <br />
