- **Pass By Value** - we can see that primitive data types when passed to another variable, are passed by value. Instead of just assigning the same address to another variable, the value is passed and a new space of memory is created. <br />
- **Pass By Reference** - we can see that while passing non-primitive data types, the assigned operator directly passes the address.<br />
- **Low level Language** - Language which is directly understood by the machine is known as the low-level language (binary language or machine language). It is difficult for a human being to directly read and do coding in this language.<br />
- **Assembly level language** -  An assembly language is almost exactly like the machine code that a computer can understand, except that it uses words in place of numbers.<br />
- **Middle-level Language** - It interacts with the abstraction layer of a computer and binds the gap between high-level and machine-level language. For example, programming languages like C and C++.<br />
- **High-level language**-  A programming language that enables programmers to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. That means this kind of programming language does not require hardware knowledge about computers. This programming language is simple to learn by human beings as it is in the human-understandable form. For example, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, etc.<br />
- **Pointer** - A pointer is a variable that stores a memory address.<br />
- **Void Pointer** - A void pointer is a pointer that has no associated data type with it.<br />
- **Dangling Pointer** - It occurs at the time of the object destruction when the object is deleted or de-allocated from memory without modifying the value of the pointer In this case, the pointer is pointing to the memory, which is de-allocated.<br />
- **Null Pointer** - NULL Pointer is a pointer that is pointing to nothing. In case, if we don’t have an address to be assigned to a pointer, then we can simply use NULL.<br />
- **Wild Pointer** - A pointer that has not been initialized to anything (not even NULL) is known as a wild pointer.<br />
- **Compiler** - A Compiler is a software utility that translates code written in a high-level language into a low-level language.
Compilers check all types of errors, limits, and ranges. Thus, it’s more intelligent.
The run time of its program is longer, and it occupies more memory.
