- **Time Complexity** - It is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.
- **Space Complexity** - It is a function describing the amount of memory an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm.
- **Abstract data type** - The abstract data type is a special kind of datatype, whose behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations. The ADT is made of primitive data types, but operation logics are hidden. Some examples of ADT are Stack, Queue, List, etc.

* **Primitive Data type** - Built in data types are known as primitive data types.<br/>

#### Examples
- boolean
- char
- byte
- short
- int
- long
- float
- double

- **Non- primitive Data type** - These data types are not actually defined by
  the programming language but are created by the programmer. They are
  also called “reference variables” or “object references” since they
  refer to a memory location which stores the data.

  
#### Examples
* Class
* Object
* String
* Array
* Interface

### What is data structure?

The data structure is a way of defining, storing & retrieving data in a structural way. A data structure may contain different types of data items.
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

### What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving logical and mathematical problems, or for accomplishing some other task
